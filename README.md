# final_python how to use

once the files are in place in the same folder

you simply run the code

once running you're faced with a menu

under that menu you'll see that you can "enter a command"

the menu it self shows six possible possibilities:
1. random quote
2.  list of quotes
3.  undo last quotes
4.  redo last quotes
5.  history of qutes used
6.  quit

what they do?

1. will produce a random quote, just enter "i" and you'll get one.
2. this one will list all the quotes
3. this one will undo a quote from the history
4. as it says, it will redo the last quote that was shown
5. this will show the history of quotes shown but the history list can be shorten by the undo command
6. this will just stop the code till you rerun it.
